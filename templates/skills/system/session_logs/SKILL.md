# Session Logs

Search your complete conversation history stored in session Markdown files.

## When to Use

✅ **USE this skill when:**

- "What did we talk about yesterday?"
- "Find the conversation where I asked about X"
- "How many sessions have I had?"
- "What was the decision we made about Y?"
- User references a past conversation not in current context

## When NOT to Use

❌ **DON'T use this skill when:**

- Current session context → already in your message history
- Application error logs → use `read_file` on log files directly
- Non-PythonClaw logs → use `run_command` with grep/rg

## Session File Location

Session files are stored under `~/.pythonclaw/context/sessions/`.

Each session is a Markdown file named `<session_id>.md` containing the full
conversation transcript.

## Commands

### List all sessions by date and size

```bash
ls -lhS ~/.pythonclaw/context/sessions/*.md
```

### Search across ALL sessions for a keyword

```bash
python {skill_path}/search_sessions.py "keyword"
```

Or with grep:

```bash
grep -rl "keyword" ~/.pythonclaw/context/sessions/*.md
```

### Read a specific session

```bash
cat ~/.pythonclaw/context/sessions/<session_id>.md
```

### Count sessions

```bash
ls ~/.pythonclaw/context/sessions/*.md | wc -l
```

## Notes

- Session files are append-only Markdown
- Large sessions can be several hundred KB — use `head`/`tail` for sampling
- Session IDs follow the pattern `<channel>_<id>` (e.g. `telegram_123456`, `web_default`)
- The `history_detail.jsonl` file contains structured tool-call logs
